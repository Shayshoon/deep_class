part1_q1 = r"""
**Your answer:**

**1. False. Consider the following split: $|Test| = |D|-1, |Train| = 1$.  We will train the model on a single datum (quite useless) and test on the entire dataset (almost). this will result in a poorly trained model with poor test results.**

**2. False. The test set should only be used to test the models accuracy. The purpose of the test set is to measure how the model performs on unseen data.**

**3. True.**

**4. True. Noise injection could be used to decrease the generalization error of the model.**
"""

part1_q2 = r"""
**Your answer:**

The question describes a data leakage. the test hyper parameters should be tuned on the validation set, not the test set.
